# Why another MP3 player?

I've been wanting to learn XAML/WPF for a long time, *and* there are some features of MP3 players that I've been wanting. Most of the work by far has been done by [https://github.com/sabapathygithub](Sabapathy), and I've been learning from his contributions. I still find XAML and its MVVM architecture kind of complicated. Oh well.
